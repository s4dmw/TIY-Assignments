### Reading APIs: Etsy

As you can tell, we'll be working with [the Etsy API documentation](https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation) this week to build out our catalog. Prepare yourself to answer the following questions about the API; more coming tomorrow!

* **How do I make API requests?**
  * What is the base URL for all requests?
  * Are there any headers or query parameters required?
  * What kind of response should I expect?
* **How does the API handle authentication?**
  * Do I _need_ to authenticate? with user credentials?
  * What can I do with an unauthenticated request?
  * How can I authenticate my request? (what methods)
